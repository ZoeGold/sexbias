Data and code for "Male-biased stone tool use by wild white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator)" by ZoÃ« Goldsborough, Margaret Crofoot, and Brendan Barrett (2023).

This repository contains the R script ("sexbias.R") required to run the main analyses reported in the manuscript, and our datasets ("agoutiseq_jt.csv" & "agoutiseq_ct.csv"), consisting of cleaned annotations of camera trap data, which have been aggregated to the sequence-level.
